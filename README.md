<h1>Welcome to My Cyber Playground üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª</h1>

<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Georgi ‚Äî a cyber enthusiast and software creator with a taste for inventive problem-solving. This repository is where I share tools, experiments, and resources built to tackle real-world security challenges and helpful tools, each with a bit of personality and a lot of purpose.</p>

<h2>What You'll Find Here ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>

<p>This collection includes everything from scanners for tracking malicious IPs to tools for testing vulnerabilities in cloud setups. Inspired by classic storytelling and the gritty realities of security work, each project has a unique flavor but remains grounded in functionality. My focus is on creating efficient, reliable tools that are also accessible and engaging, whether you‚Äôre a security professional or a curious tech enthusiast.</p>

**üõ† Project Highlights:**  
Explore tools like the ‚ÄúGoblin Sniffer‚Äù ‚Äî an IP threat scanner with an eye for shady activity ‚Äî or ‚ÄúBinBot,‚Äù a binary translator with a friendly side. For a full list of projects, check the links below.

<h3>Technologies & Certifications</h3>
