### What This Is

A stash of tools and experiments where sarcasm meets functionality‚Äîlike a rabbit hole you didn't know you needed to fall into. Think of it as a digital cabinet of curiosities, perfect for those who find themselves chasing after strange ideas or *accidentally* solving problems. Poke around if you must‚Äîwho knows, you might stumble upon something that‚Äôs *actually* useful... or not.

## Why Bother?
Why indeed? This repository probably has something you don‚Äôt need, but might enjoy finding anyway. Think of it as a distraction disguised as productivity.

## If It Breaks, It‚Äôs a Feature
Nothing here is guaranteed to make sense, function as expected, or save the world. But hey, isn‚Äôt that half the fun? Explore responsibly. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.
